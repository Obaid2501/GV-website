    Professor B. K. Mishra is the Director of Indian Institute of Technology Goa since March 2017.
    Prior to joining IIT Goa he was Director of CSIR-IMMT Bhubaneswar and Professor at IIT Kanpur.
    <br>
    He graduated with a Bachelors degree in Metallurgical Engineering from N.I.T. Rourkela, in 1981 and then obtained his Ph.D. degree from University of Utah, USA in the year 1990 and continued there for his post-doctoral research. In the year 1993, he returned to India and joined I.I.T. Kanpur to start his teaching career. He is recognized for his contribution in the field of Extractive Metallurgy, Powder Technology and Mathematical Modelling. Prof. Mishra has taught in University of Utah, USA and Aston University in UK on sabbatical and has published over 240 SCI journal papers in minerals, metallurgy, and powder technology area.
    <br>
    Prof. Mishra started his research career in discrete element method (DEM) to solve tumbling mill problems. His original research work on DEM has led to the development of commercial software to design grinding mills, planetary mills, spirals, fludized beds, and jigging systems. He has also worked in the area of DEM simulations of agglomeration of particles and impact breakage of pre- bonded agglomerates. Prof. Mishra’s recent work on DEM includes studies on the causes of dead zone formation inside drum mixers. He is currently working on liquid-solid bridge transition modeling for efficient simulation of pelletization, sintering, and fluidized bed reactors.
    <br>
    He was a member of the editorial board of several international journals. He is the recipient of the National Geoscience Award and is a fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering. For his contribution to industrial  he received the VASVIK Award. He was a Member of the Expert Committee formed by Hon’ble Supreme Court for Environmental Impact Assessment study in the state of Goa relating to iron ore mining. Few months back he received the CSIR Technology Award (team award) from honorable President of India.
    <br>
    Professor Mishra is committed to promote a collaborative environment that spurs innovations in learning and research and it is this enduring commitment that he brings to the position of Director of IIT Goa.
